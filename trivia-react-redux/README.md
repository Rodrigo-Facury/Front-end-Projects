# Trivia-React-Redux!

This project demonstrates my experience with some very important technologies and concepts concerning Front-End web development, such as: **React.js**, **CSS**, **Redux**, **API requests**, **Single-Page Application** and **React Router Dom**.

The app was the product of a group work. We (a group of 5 people) had 5 days to develop this app and we achieved all the minimum requirements before the deadline. This happened because we collaborated and comunicated, giving constant feedbacks to one another. We also used agile methodologies to controll and accelerate the workflow (Kanban - using Trello, and Scrum - using Zoom for the sprints' meetings). All this happened in a remote environment.

## Instructions to use the app:

* Clone the repository on your computer;
* Install the dependencies: npm install;
* Start the app locally: npm start;
* Play away!

In this app, you can use a name of you preference, as long as it has 3 or more letters. You can also use your Gravatar e-mail to have your picture on display. At the end of the game, you can find a score-board. Enjoy yourself! If you have any question, please don't hesitate to contact me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-facury/
