# Recipes App!

This project demonstrates my experience with some very important technologies and concepts concerning Front-End web development, such as: **React.js**, **CSS**, **React Hooks**, **API requests**, **Context API**, **Single-Page Application** and **React Router Dom**.

The app was the product of a group work. We (a group of 5 people) had 10 days to develop this app and we achieved 98% of the requirements 2 days before the deadline. This happened because we collaborated and communicated, giving constant feedback to one another. We also used agile methodologies to control and accelerate the workflow (Kanban - using Trello, and Scrum - using Zoom for the sprints' meetings). All this happened in a remote environment.

## Instructions to use the app:

* Clone the repository on your computer;
* Install the dependencies: npm install;
* Start the app locally: npm start.

The intention was to simulate the usage from one cell phone. So, for it's best performance:

* Right-click on the app;
* Click on inspect;
* On the center-top of the page, you will find 2 inputs to adjust the pixels;
* Adjust them to 360 x 640 (At this specific order).

In this app, you are able to click on the recipe cards and see details of the recipe, such as ingredients, steps for preparation, a video to help you through the recipe and combinations. All that you can find in the foods page as well as in the drinks page. You can also add the recipe to your list of favorites and see them whenever you want. Enjoy yourself!
